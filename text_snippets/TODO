DONE dd "vampires" as a character
Create snippets for tuning purposes!


DONE Fix discrepancy b/w anaphora and ner - instead of Elizabeth, Elizabeth the vampire - want to have start index of both and that can show its the same

Evaluation
	NER
		DONE Take a percentage of a book from early period and hand tag it with NER
		DONE Take from a newer book
		See how precision and recall compare.
	ANAPHORA
		How well did it do the resolution? - precision and recall - write a program to check those. What is in the file that should be and what is not in the file that should be?
	VAMPIRE
		Take same text sections and make binary decision if it got the vampire or not



Training: pick a book from each year-span bin and choose a small section to hand-tag. This will be to tune.
Everything else will be test set.
